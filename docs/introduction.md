# Red Hat Managed Application Services CLI

Red Hat Managed Application Services is a combination of tightly integrated Red Hat technologies you can use to build a cloud infrastructure,
develop cloud-native apps, and orchestrate deployments across hybrid IT environments. 
It's everything you could possibly need to create—and be productive in—a hybrid cloud.

The Red Hat Cloud CLI manages services created in Red Hat cloud, authentication, local configuration, developer workflow and general interactions with Red Hat Cloud. Red Hat cloud CLI will allow you to perform common tasks without visiting cloud.redhat.com.
